Linear programming tutorial
===========================

[This short tutorial on linear programming](https://ivanistheone.github.io/linear_programming/tutorial.pdf) 
used to be part of the [No bullshit guide to linear algebra](http://gum.co/noBSLA), 
but was cut from the main text of the book, because it might not be interesting to all readers.

Business students will find this tutorial useful as it gives three points of view:
  - algorithmic (the steps of the simplex algorithm)
  - graphical (visual representation of the various coordinate systems used during algorithm)
  - numerical (practical computations using the computer algebr system SymPy)


Story
-----
This "feature cut" was done back in Jun 2015. Here is the commit message:

    changeset:   185:3ca7ddf396f7

    summary:     Moved Linear Programming out of Applications chapter. 
                 No way I can hold the readers attention for 20 pages with that shit. 
                 Will release it as a bonus free tutorial or something.


Todo
----
  - Finish the section on duality 
  - Add more illustrations


The book
--------
Readers interested in learning about linear algebra explained in a text that 
gets to the point should check out the book where this tutorial was supposed 
to appear: the [No bullshit guide to linear algebra](http://gum.co/noBSLA).
