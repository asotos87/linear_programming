Linear programming
==================

This is short tutorial on linear programming (LP) that used to be part of the [No bullshit guide to linear algebra](http://gum.co/noBSLA), 
but was cut from the main text because it might not be interesting to all readers.

Business students will find this tutorial useful as it gives three points of view:
  - algorithmic (the steps of the simplex algorithm)
  - graphical (visual representation of row pivots)
  - numerical (fast computations using SymPy)


Story
-----
This "feature cut" was done back in Jun 2015. Here is the commit message:

    changeset:   185:3ca7ddf396f7

    summary:     Moved Linear Programming out of Applications chapter. 
                 No way I can hold the readers attention for 20 pages with that shit. 
                 Will release it as a bonus free tutorial or something.


Todo
----
  - Finish the section on duality 
  - Add more illustrations
  - Make pdf accessible at a fixed URL so I can link to it in book


The book
--------
Readers interested in learning about linear algebra explained in a text that 
gets to the point should check out the book where this tutorial was supposed 
to appear: the [No bullshit guide to linear algebra](http://gum.co/noBSLA).
